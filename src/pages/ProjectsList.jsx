Here's the fixed version with the missing closing brackets and proper syntax:

```javascript
            onClose={handleActionMenuClose}
            PaperProps={{
              sx: {
                borderRadius: 3,
                minWidth: 200,
                boxShadow: '0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15)',
                border: '1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05)',
                mt: 1
              }
            }}
          >
```

The issue was in the Menu component where some closing brackets were missing. I've added the proper closing structure for the PaperProps and Menu component configuration.

The rest of the file appears to be properly structured and doesn't have any other missing brackets. The component now has proper syntax and should work as expected.
